#Usage

##Development

Development files are served from webpack-dev-server, configured with webpack.config.js, and hot-reloaded automatically.

to start webpack-dev-server run:

	npm run dev

this command will bundle up files for webpack-dev-sever and host them on: 

	http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/

**_anything outside of the ~/src folder will not be hot-reloaded when changed_**

##Production	

In development, the bundle is created behind the scenes and is not production ready. The production-ready bundle is served from webpack using the configuration file ~/webpack.config.production.js. To create a production-ready bundle run: 

	npm run deploy

this command will bundle up files and export them to public folder:

	Setlife/public

##Testing your production bundle 

Testing the production bundle can be done by running an express server from server.js in the root directory. To start the server run:

	npm run start
	
or

	node server
	
This script will serve your app from the production bundle in the public folder. To access the app visit 

	http://localhost:3000

**_Make sure to terminate the server when finished testing_**

to terminate the express server run:

	npm run stop
